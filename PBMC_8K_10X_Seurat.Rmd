#Installation
#install.package('Seurat')
library(Seurat)
library(dplyr)
#??Seurat
```
```{r}
#LOAD RAW DATA FILE
pbmc_8k <- Read10X_h5("pbmc8k_raw_gene_bc_matrices_h5.h5")
#Check size as dense or sparse dataset
object.size(x=as.matrix(x=pbmc_8k)) # convert to standard dense matrix: vector memory exhausted
object.size(x=pbmc_8k) #in the original sparse format: 341899568 bytes (341MB)
#?Read10X_h5
#Seurat Data versions: raw.data, data, and scale.data

#raw.data: untouched matrix file

#data: filtered, normalized and log2 transformed. Positive or 0 values only. The input for most visualization, differential analysis and stats functions

#scale.data: Each cell:gene value is expressed relative to gene for all other cells, and data is 0-centered. Input for dimension reduction and clustering


```

```{r}
#FILTER DATA: keep genes expression in at least 3 cells: cuts noise from non-expressed genes
# keep cells expressing at least 200 genes: excludes non-cell GEMs
#populate the raw.data slot, this data is untouched, and straight away, it is filtered here
pbmc <- CreateSeuratObject(raw.data=pbmc_8k, min.cells =3, min.genes=200, project ="10X_PBMC_8K")
```

```{r}
#PRE-PROCESSING 
# Automatic processes: 1. Number of genes expressed:nGene 2. Number of UMIs: nUMI 

#Calculate percent.mito, which is a metric that indicates whether a cell has an apoptotic signature

#Get genes that start with MT from the data matrix
mito.genes <- grep(pattern="^MT-", x=rownames(x=pbmc@data), value=TRUE)
#sum up Matrix rows that are mito, divided by sum of all matrix rows
percent.mito <- Matrix::colSums(pbmc@raw.data[mito.genes,])/Matrix::colSums(pbmc@raw.data)
summary(percent.mito)
#Add percent.mito data to metadata

```{r}
pbmc <-AddMetaData(object=pbmc, metadata= percent.mito, col.name = "percent.mito")
#Custom Seurat plot
VlnPlot(object=pbmc, features.plot = c("nGene","nUMI","percent.mito"), nCol=3, point.size.use = 0.1)
??VlnPlot
#There are cells with high percent.mito content, and cells with low nUMI which should be filtered out
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

#The number on top of the graph is Pearson correlation coefficient

```
```{r}
